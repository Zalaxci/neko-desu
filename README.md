## A brief trip to the past...<br>
### ...back to 2020,
when this site was created it was a startpage website. Its main feature was a fancy do-it-all search box that can open bookmarks stored in JSON, search various sites like DuckDuckGo, Google and YouTube and search gifs / images. It also had a weather and clock applet.
### ...during August 2022,
I attepmted to create a better startpage named _rectangulist_ while also learning Nuxt.js and Vue. It was planned to be more serious and instead of silly gifs and youtube videos that I liked when I was a silly and edgy teenager it would mainly incorporate a TODO-list to use in 2022 when I was a somewhat less silly and edgy teenager studying for exams. But it was never finished and the repo is still in a folder in my computer, with some code waiting to be commited...
### ...finally, in February 2024,
I learned about "nekoweb.org", a cool free static site hosting service made to recreate the retro web of free creativity. This made wanna create my own retro-looking site, even tho I am too young and haven't experienced the web in the early 2000s. But because I didn't want my site to be visible in nekoweb's frontpage and I was worried about speed and sustainability, I decided to create my own hub of websites, named "neko-de.su" (I am a cat in Japanese), which is what I renamed this repo to. It expanded on the search feature (using LitJS this time around) and had a brief about section as well as a clock widget. But I decided to drop the name as it was too cringe / "weeb"-like, change the description a bit and add some new features resembling an OS / desktop environment.
